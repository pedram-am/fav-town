                    <p>Having afternoon tea is one of the most enjoyable English pastimes. Traditionally served with a freshly baked scone, cream tea is pretty much as it sounds: tea, with cream added. Once your scone is served, it is customary to top it with jam before adding clotted cream. In Devon, it's the other way around. </p>
